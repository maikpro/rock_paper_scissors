## Rules of the Game

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple game usually played between two people. The players count to three in unison and simultaneously throw one of three hand signs representing rock, paper, or scissors. The winner of the game is determined by the rules below:

1. **Rock** crushes scissors (Rock wins)
2. **Scissors** cuts paper (Scissors wins)
3. **Paper** covers rock (Paper wins)

- If both players throw the same hand sign, it is a tie and usually the game is played again until a winner is found.

- To simplify only process three rounds and present the result. - Tie or Win based on the three attempts.
